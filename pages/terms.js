            fundraising groups which may not hyperlink to our Web site.
            These organizations may link to our home page, to publications, or to other Website information so long as the
            link: (a) is not in any way deceptive; (b) does not falsely imply sponsorship, endorsement, or approval of the

          </p>

            with us; (c) the benefit to us from the visibility of the hyperlink compensates the absence of Youbarter; and (d)
            the link is in the context of general resource information.
